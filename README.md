Code for Micro Skid Steer built in Engineering Class 2024-2025 at MSSM

This is the movement code for the micro skid steer. The Arduino file commands the connection between the controller and each individual movement joint. The .ccp and .h files are responsible for creating an abstract class for the motor and then implementing it. The motor implementation is fully functional and it is not recommended to modify it.
